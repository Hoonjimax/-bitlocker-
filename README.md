# -bitlocker-
This is Ransomware!!

This virus was tested on Windows 11. It is ransomware.**Do not run it on your real computer as it could erase all your files.** It works by downloading key.exe and key1.exe to the path C:Program FilesCommon Fileswindows, turning off User Account Control, registering it as a startup program, and then restarting.After Windows starts, bitlocker.exe will automatically run, encrypting all files on the D drive (C drive is not encrypted) and making Windows unusable. (There is no exception handling, so **if you reboot, the encryption process will run twice, making decryption impossible even if the original creator comes back!!** Decryption occurs when the encryption key is sent via webhook and stored on my Discord server.There are ways to prevent bitlocker.exe from running and to delete it, but then it becomes impossible to decrypt the files. Since I did not create a decryption tool, decryption becomes impossible after one reboot of the PC.Also, the code for the program that encrypts files has been lost, so the code cannot be known anymore.**If you choose to download this program, knowing there is a risk that all files on the D drive could vanish, the creator of the program disclaims any responsibility for the encrypted files.**

**++Don't mess with the webhook!!**
